## Intermediate Output

Here are some plots from my 2nd-year project which studies the effect of water pollution on beverage manufacturers' entry decisions. The sample period is from 2006 to 2019.

### Data Sources: 
- Dissolved oxygen (DO) readings from [Water Quality Portal](https://www.waterqualitydata.us/)
- Firm location from Data Axle, accessed through [Wharton Research Data Services](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/about/data-vendors/infogroup/)
- Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) annual allotments from [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/cwsrf/clean-water-state-revolving-fund-cwsrf-allotments-federal-funds-states) 
- Demographics from American Community Surveys, accessed through [IPUMS](https://www.ipums.org/)
- Stream network and flow direction from [USGS NHDPlusV2](https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography/nhdplus-high-resolution)
- Weather from [PRISM Annual Normals (M4)](https://prism.oregonstate.edu/normals/)

### Descriptive Statistics:
At annual, county level:

1. Average DO Concentrations

2. Average Net Entry of Beverage Manufacturers

### Preliminary Result:
Using upstream state's past CWSRF allotment as an instrument for the downstream, adjacent county's DO readings, I found that firms are more likely to locate at places with cleaner water. The plot below shows the first-stage estimates with different lags and leads:
