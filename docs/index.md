### Hello!

This is a testing website for **FOSS 2023 Capstone Project** created by [Yun-Ting Yeh](yyeh@arizona.edu). I plan to populate the website as my research progresses :smiley: :feet:.

### Short Bio

I am a third-year PhD student in Economics at the University of Arizona :cactus:. My research interests lie in the fields of empirical industrial organization and environmental and energy economics. I am currently working on a project that studies the relationship between water pollution and manufacturers' entry (2nd-year project) as well as a joint project that looks at smog inspection (very preliminary).
